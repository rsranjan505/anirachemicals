                        <p>RCON Brickbond fast set accelerator is a ready-to-use, powdered admixture which has to dissolve in plain water. It accelerates initial setting time one to three times faster than normal fly ash bricks or blocks. RCON Brickbond improves workability and strength while hastening the hydration of cement. It makes the mix easier to place and speeds the production of fly ash bricks or blocks by shortening the initial set and curing time. Time and labor are saved because forms and other protection can be removed earlier and finishing can be started.</p>
                        <h2>Advantages:</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>•	Accelerated set times.</li>
                            <li>•	Increases compressive strength.</li>
                            <li>•	RCON Brickbond will reduce the setting time of fly ash Bricks thus enabling earlier finishing times to be achieved, especially when concrete temperatures are low. Finishing time can be reduced by up to 6 to 8 hours when RCON Brickbond is used.</li>
                            <li>•	Early removal of Bricks from pallets to produce more Bricks and reduce labor costs.</li>
                            <li>•	High-density Bricks can be produced when used RCON Brickbond.</li>
                            <li>•	Prevention of EDGES and corner breaking during stacking and shifting.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2>Other Detail</h2>
                        <p>
                            By Using RCON Brickbond, Strength Of The Fly ash Brick/Blocks Or Fly ash Products Will Increase By 25-30 Percent.
                        </p>
                        <p>Cement Can Be Reduced 5% To 20% Based On The Mix Design And Production Practice. </br>
                        RCON Brickbond Gives Early Strength To Fly ash Products, Resulting In Zero Damages And Edge Breakages </br>
                        Products Can Be Shifted Outside To Stock Yard After 18-24 Hours Without Any Damages And Breakages.</br>
                        Water Curing Or Any Other Type Of Curing Is Not Required.</br>
                        Products Can Be Delivered To Market After 24-48 Hours Of Air Curing.</p>
